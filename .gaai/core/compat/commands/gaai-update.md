# /gaai-update

Update the GAAI framework or switch AI tool adapter.

## What This Does

1. Updates `.gaai/core/` to the latest version from the framework repo
2. Preserves `.gaai/project/` (your backlog, memory, artefacts)
3. Optionally switches the AI tool adapter (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf)
4. Runs a health check to verify integrity

## When to Use

- After pulling a newer version of the GAAI framework repo
- To switch AI tool (e.g., from Cursor to Claude Code)
- To redeploy adapters or slash commands after a corrupt state

## Instructions for Claude Code

You are running a GAAI framework update.

**Step 1 — Find the installer**

Look for `.gaai/core/scripts/install.sh` in the current working directory. If it is not present, tell the user: "No `.gaai/core/scripts/install.sh` found. Ensure `.gaai/` is present in this project."

**Step 2 — Ask what to update**

Ask the user:
- "Update framework core from a source repo? If so, provide the path to the GAAI framework repo (e.g., `/tmp/gaai`)."
- "Or just redeploy adapters for a different AI tool? If so, which tool: claude-code, cursor, windsurf, or other?"

Wait for their answer.

**Step 3 — Run the installer**

If updating from a source repo:

```bash
bash <source-repo>/.gaai/core/scripts/install.sh --target . --tool claude-code --yes
```

If just redeploying adapters (same project):

```bash
bash .gaai/core/scripts/install.sh --target . --tool <chosen-tool> --yes
```

**Step 4 — Report outcome**

If the update succeeded (exit code 0), confirm success and show the health check results.

If it failed, show the error output and suggest checking permissions or file integrity.
